# Decentralized Energy Grid Management System

## Overview
The **Decentralized Energy Grid Management System** is a blockchain-based platform designed to manage distributed energy resources and facilitate peer-to-peer energy trading. It leverages smart contracts for energy production, consumption, and trading, while NFTs represent energy assets or significant milestones in renewable energy production.

## Features
- **Energy Grid Coordination**:
    - Users can produce, consume, and trade energy in a decentralized manner.
    - Real-time tracking of energy production and consumption.
- **Smart Contracts**:
    - **Energy Production**: Verifiable and transparent logging of generated energy.
    - **Energy Consumption**: Automated tracking and payment settlements.
    - **Peer-to-Peer Trading**: Direct energy trading between producers and consumers.
- **NFT Integration**:
    - **Energy Asset Representation**: NFTs represent energy production achievements and assets.
    - **Renewable Energy Milestones**: Tokenized records of renewable energy contributions.
- **Real-Time Data Integration**:
    - **Smart Meters**: Seamless integration with smart meters for live energy data.
    - **Grid Infrastructure**: Connection with existing grid infrastructure for optimized energy distribution.

## Technology Stack
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum, Solana, or Stacks
- **Smart Contract Language**: Solidity, Clarity
- **Storage**: IPFS/Arweave for decentralized storage
- **NFTs**: ERC-721/ERC-1155 for energy asset representation
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js for user interface
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express for API interactions
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for off-chain metadata

## How It Works
1. **Energy Registration**:
    - Producers register their energy generation units on the platform.
    - Verification ensures compliance with grid standards.
2. **Energy Tracking & Trading**:
    - Smart contracts record real-time energy production and consumption.
    - Peer-to-peer trading enables direct transactions between users.
3. **NFT-Based Energy Representation**:
    - Energy milestones and assets are tokenized as NFTs.
    - Consumers can support and trade renewable energy tokens.
4. **Grid & Smart Meter Integration**:
    - Smart meters update real-time consumption data on-chain.
    - Grid infrastructure adapts dynamically to supply and demand.
